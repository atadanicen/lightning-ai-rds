# Configure the SFTP Setup
SFTP simplifies the process of uploading your files to the RDS
1. Install the `SFTP` extension from VS Code marketplace then configure the `SFTP.json` file.
```json
{
    "name": "lightning",
    "host": "ssh.lightning.ai",
    "protocol": "sftp",
    "port": 22,
    "username": "your_ssh_username",
    "remotePath": "/teamspace/studios/this_studio",
    "uploadOnSave": false,
    "useTempFile": false,
    "openSsh": false,
    "privateKeyPath": "your_ssh_private_key_path"
}
```
 - After that you can right click on your files in VS Code and upload them to RDS.
